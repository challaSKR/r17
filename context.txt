- For single record review - duo.set_review procedure


- For single record approval we are creating change log do.Create_Changelog procedure


- So we I send multiple records in the payload.


- So my doubt is ? can we update these records in procedure itself, Since if any  one of the record CURD operation failed , we should rollback the transaction and send the response to UI saying review failed . So none of the items in the request got updated and stay as it is.

- Or we can do this nodejs using transactions
